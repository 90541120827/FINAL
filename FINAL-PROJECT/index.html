                    <h5 class="card-title">Electric Vehicle Innovation</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">Tesla has revolutionized the automotive industry with its relentless pursuit of electric vehicle (EV) innovation. The company's lineup, including the Model S, Model 3, Model X, and Model Y, has redefined expectations for EVs. By focusing on sleek design, impressive performance, and extended range, Tesla has shattered the stereotype of electric cars as slow and limited in range. This approach has not only attracted environmentally conscious consumers but also those who appreciate cutting-edge technology and high-performance vehicles.

                      Beyond aesthetics and performance, Tesla's innovative spirit is evident in its Supercharger network. This extensive charging infrastructure offers high-speed charging capabilities, reducing the concern of range anxiety and making long-distance travel feasible for EV owners. </p>

                    <h5 class="card-title">Autonomous Driving</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">Tesla has been at the forefront of autonomous driving technology, pushing the boundaries of what's possible on the road. The company's Autopilot system, an advanced driver-assistance feature, incorporates a suite of sensors, cameras, and AI-powered software to provide semi-autonomous capabilities. These include features like adaptive cruise control, automatic lane-keeping, and even self-parking.

                      Tesla's ambition doesn't stop at partial autonomy. The company is actively working towards achieving full self-driving capability, aiming to create a vehicle that can navigate and make decisions without human intervention. While this technology is still in the testing and refinement stages, Tesla's dedication to autonomous driving has sparked debates about its feasibility, safety, and regulatory challenges, further shaping the conversation.</p>

              <h3 class="h1text3 line">Founder</h3>
              <p id="team-des">Martin Eberhard (born 1960 or 1961) is an American inventor, engineer and entrepreneur who co-founded Tesla, Inc. (then Tesla Motors) with Marc Tarpenning in 2003. Eberhard served as Tesla's original chairman, and its CEO until late 2007. In 2015, he was inducted into the University of Illinois Engineering Hall of Fame.Eberhard's interest in sports cars, concern about the dependence on oil imports, and global warming led him to think about EV cars as part of the solution. He found out about and attempted to purchase a prototype EV sports car called the AC Propulsion tzero. </p>

 
              <p id="team-des2">Eberhard’s guiding principles were: 1) An electric car should not be a compromise. With the right technology choices, it is possible to build electric cars that are actually better cars than their competition. 2) Battery technology is key to a successful electric car. Lithium ion batteries are not only suitable of automotive use; they are game-changing, making decent driving range a reality. 3) If designed right, electric cars can appeal to even the most serious car enthusiast, as electric drive is capable of seriously outperforming internal combustion engines.
